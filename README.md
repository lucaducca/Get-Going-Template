Welcome to Get Going, the free website template and guide!

I built this template to help non-technical, pre-product startup founders and hobbyists, like you, create a website quickly, easily and importantly, for free!

(I got the idea after spending a whole day setting up a landing page of my own using a no code website builder.)

I hope you find it useful!

The instructions for how to use the template can be found [here](https://lucaducca.github.io/jgg-main-page/instructions/instructions.html).
